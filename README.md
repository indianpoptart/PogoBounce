# PogoBounce
A new game based using Metal for iOS

##Metal for Developers
Metal provides the lowest-overhead access to the GPU, enabling you to maximize the graphics and compute potential of your iOS 8 app. 
With a streamlined API, precompiled shaders, and support for efficient multi-threading, Metal can take your game or graphics app to the next level of performance and capability.


##
This app will either be 2D or 3D, whichever one is better for the game. 2D is probably better since it takes less processing power, and consumes less battery.
